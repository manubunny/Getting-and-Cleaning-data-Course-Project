2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps required to start this project.
1. Make sure you have required libraries (data.table)loaded prior to run this script.
2. Download and save "UCI HAR Dataset" data in current working directory of R Studio manually.
3. Created new R script in working directory "run_analysis.R".
4. Required text files are read from current working directory in R script.
5. Run "run_analysis.R". A new tidy file will be craeted in working directory named "final_data.txt".
